# Healthy Living Investments - Website Design

This is a web design services guide to different types of websites which are offered through Healthy Living Investments.  

They include:
- user experience and customer focused websites
- brand marketing websites
- portfolio designs

Each of the types of websites reflect all of the above.  However, they have different focuses.

I am certified in web development.  I am taking an awesome course by Yaakov Chaiken of JHU in Web Development.
